# Site Footer

Global footer used on every page (same structure as the Lightly Salted homepage footer from the design).

**Editable at:** WP Admin → Global Options → **Footer**

Content (logo, tagline, description, social links, nav groups, badges, copyright, legal links) is stored in Global Options so one change applies site-wide.
